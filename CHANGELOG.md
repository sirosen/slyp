# Unreleased

# 0.1.1

- If CST traversal hits recursion depth, this is now reported as an internal
  error without aborting the entire run of `slyp`
- `W103` now ignores a multiline string join which is the only string inside
  of a container type.

# 0.1.0

- `--disable` and `--enable` now support the special string "all" to refer to
  all codes. Explicit enables and disables are given higher precedence than "all".
- Add `E110` for catching the return of a known-`None` variable immediately
  after testing it (prefer to return `None`, not the variable name)
- `--disable` and `--disable` now support categories, as in `--disable W`
  to disable all warnings.
- The `E101`, `E102`, and `E103` codes have each been downgraded to warnings
  (`W` category) but are still enabled by default
- The matching AST checker now considers the triviality and proximity of
  matching AST nodes. By default, only the check for non-trivial adjacent
  branches is enabled.
  - Add `W201`, `W202`, and `W203` to describe the disabled checks
  - Triviality is defined as a heuristic which captures simple expressions and
    statements (e.g. `return None` is a trivial statement)
- Add support for `--enable` to turn on disabled codes

# 0.0.3

- Add `--disable` for turning off specific codes
- Various minor speed improvements, resulting in ~5% faster runs on large
  codebases
- Invert verbosity control by removing `-q/--quiet` and adding `-v/--verbose`.
  Verbose output is now opt-in, not opt-out.

# 0.0.2

- Add pre-commit-hooks config, allowing use with pre-commit

# 0.0.1

- Initial release
