## Hi

:wave:

I'm Stephen. I'm going to lint your Python code.

I wrote this linter because nothing else out there implemented these rules, and
some of them needed CST (rather than AST), so there was no plugin framework
(e.g. flake8 plugins) which I could use.
I hope it helps you catch slyp-ups.

## Installation

`slyp` is a python package and can be run as a pre-commit hook.

On supported python versions, it should be installed with

```console
pip install slyp
```

## Usage

Either use it as a CLI tool:

```console
slyp src/
```

Or as a pre-commit hook using the following `pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/sirosen/slyp
  rev: 0.1.0
  hooks:
    - id: slyp
```

### Options and Arguments

`[files...]`: If passed positional arguments, `slyp` will treat them as
filenames to check.
Otherwise, it will search the current directory for python files.

`-v/--verbose`: Enable more verbose output

`--use-git-ls`: Find files to check by doing a `git ls-files` call and filtering
the results to files which appear to be python.
This is mutually exclusive with any filename arguments.

`--disable CODES`: Pass a comma-delimited list of codes to turn off.

`--enable CODES`: Pass a comma-delimited list of codes to turn on.

## Implemented Rules

<!-- generate-reference-insert-start -->

E is for "error" (you should probably change this)

W is for "warning" (you might want to change this)

Some warnings are disabled by default; enable them with `--enable`.

### E100

'unnecessary string concat'

```python
x = "foo " "bar"
```

### W101

'unparenthesized multiline string concat in keyword arg'

```python
foo(
    bar="alpha "
    "beta"
)
```

### W102

'unparenthesized multiline string concat in dict value'

```python
{
    "foo": "alpha "
    "beta"
}
```

### W103

'unparenthesized multiline string concat in collection type'

```python
x = (  # a tuple
    "alpha "
    "beta",
    "gamma"
)
x = {  # or a set
    "alpha "
    "beta",
    "gamma"
}
```

### W120

'unparenthesized multiline union in parameter annotation'

```python
def foo(
    x: int |
    str
):
    return x
```

### E110

'returning a variable checked as None, rather than returning None'

```python
if x is None:
    return x  # should be `return None`
```

### W200

'two AST branches have identical contents'

```python
if x is True:
    return y + 1
else:
    # some comment
    return y + 1
```

### W201

_disabled by default_

'two AST branches have identical trivial contents'

```python
if x is True:
    return
else:
    return
```

### W202

_disabled by default_

'two non-adjacent AST branches have identical contents'

```python
if x is True:
    return foo(bar())
elif y is True:
    return 0
elif z is True:
    return 1
else:
    return foo(bar())
```

### W203

_disabled by default_

'two non-adjacent AST branches have identical trivial contents'

```python
if x is True:
    return None
elif y is True:
    return 0
elif z is True:
    return 1
else:
    return None
```
